                <p>When you work in a brewery, you quickly realise a lot of time is gobbled up finding data, filling out
                    reports, and figuring out what's working well and how to keep the good vibes flowing.</p>
                <p>Every week, I watched our brewing team glued to their screens, wading through paper to gather the
                    info they needed to plug into spreadsheets and churn out reports. So, I decided to wave my magic
                    wand and build an automation tool to get them off their chairs and back to crafting our amazing
                    beer.</p>
                <p>Step one: ditch as much of the paper reporting as possible and get the info entered into Brewman, our
                    trusty brewery management software.</p>
                <p>Next up, I needed to extract the data from Brewman. An API would have been a dream, but alas, Brewman
                    didn't have one for the production side. They had an API for sales data to sync with accounting
                    software. After chatting with Premier Systems, the brains behind Brewman, they showed interest in
                    building a production API but said it would take a while.</p>
                <p>The only option left was to roll up my sleeves and build an automation and web scraping tool to fetch
                    the data.</p>
                <p>After a pow-wow with our Production Manager, I had a laundry list of pages to gather the data from.
                    Thankfully, most of the data could be exported into a CSV file.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-on-right">
                <img src="" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section-with-image-and-text">
            <div class="image-on-left">
                <img src="" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="text-on-right">
                <p>So, I dived into Python and used the Selenium module to take control of a Chrome browser. I got it to
                    navigate to Brewman and log in using my credentials. Planning ahead, I saved my login details in a
                    separate JSON file, just in case anyone peeked at my code.</p>
                <p>Once I nailed the login, I ran into my first snag. Our Brewman package only allows 15 concurrent
                    users. With the sales team entering orders, drivers logging deliveries, and brewers posting data,
                    this limit fills up fast. When it hits 15 users, a pop-up asks you to boot someone out. You select
                    from a list of logged-in users and see how long they've been inactive. Our golden rule: never log
                    out a driver since they're often inactive between drops. I needed to build logic to pick the longest
                    inactive user who wasn't a driver. Multiple users can change roles and help with deliveries, I
                    decided to put this on hold and manually handle logins if OLIVER flagged an error.</p>

                <p>Keeping tabs on what OLIVER was doing got tricky. One misstep and the whole thing would topple. One
                    wrong automated click, and nothing worked.</p>
                <p>I used a ton of print statements to track what was happening. This let me see where my script logic
                    failed, and boy, did it fail often in the beginning.</p>
                <p>Tracking all those print statements became a nightmare, so I wrote a nifty function in Python to add
                    colours, timestamps, and line numbers to each print statement. This was a game changer. It may be my
                    dyslexia, scotopic sensitivity, or just that reading line after line of plain text is tough on the
                    eyes, but this colourful solution made it super easy to see what was happening and where.</p>
                <p>Here's my little code gem:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-python">
                ### Print Statement Decorator
                def print_t(message):
                    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
                    frame_info = inspect.getframeinfo(inspect.currentframe().f_back)
                    line_number = frame_info.lineno
            
                    # ANSI escape codes for text colour
                    colors = [
                        '\033[91m',         # Red
                        '\033[38;5;208m',   # Orange
                        '\033[93m',         # Yellow
                        '\033[92m',         # Green
                        '\033[96m',         # Cyan
                        '\033[94m',         # Blue
                        '\033[35m',         # Purple
                        '\033[95m',         # Magenta        
                    ]
                    reset_color = '\033[0m'
            
                    # Alternate the colour index with each print statement
                    print_t.color_index = (print_t.color_index + 1) % len(colors)
            
                    colored_message = f'{colors[print_t.color_index]}Line {line_number}  {message} [{timestamp}]{reset_color}'
                    print(colored_message)
            
                # Initialize color_index attribute
                print_t.color_index = 0
                </code></pre>
                <p>Use the 'print_t' function with your print statement, and voil√†, you'll have a rainbow of colourful,
                    timestamped print statements noting the line number.</p>

                <p>Once I logged in and could track the print statements, I realised OLIVER didn't need complex
                    instructions on where to click. I could just give OLIVER a list of URLs to navigate straight to the
                    right pages.</p>
                <p>I could get most data about how much beer was brewed from an export in the reporting section. The
                    reports run in Tableau, embedded in Brewman. I needed OLIVER to change screen levels to select
                    export options. I chose to export the data in its loaded format. My concern was the report structure
                    could change, forcing me to constantly update the automation paths. I loved building OLIVER, but I
                    didn't want to keep updating HTML paths.</p>
                <p>Once exported, the report landed in the download directory. I then saved it to a SharePoint site
                    using the Microsoft Graph API.</p>
                <p>This was fine for the first upload, but for weekly updates, I needed only the new data. I instructed
                    OLIVER to find the last file uploaded to SharePoint, log the latest date in that file, open the
                    downloaded file, delete old data, and save the updated file in SharePoint.</p>
                <p>I repeated these steps for another report and scraped data from other pages, saving all the data in a
                    single CSV file accessible from SharePoint. It may seem odd to use a CSV file, but I wanted the
                    source data accessible to anyone without coding knowledge. This way, if I'm on holiday and something
                    goes wrong, anyone can access the data without calling me.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="section-with-text-and-image">
            <div class="text-on-left">
                <p>With all the data gathered, I needed to display it. The plan was to put up screens where the
                    production team could see them, so they didn't have to hunt for info; it would be there, ready to
                    consume.</p>
                <p>I started building a web app using Flask. It fetched data from my main CSV file and displayed it
                    using Plotly for graphs and CSS for data cards.</p>
                <p>Once everything was displayed, I set up an automatic updater for OLIVER to run each Monday and
                    timestamp the run in a JSON file. If more than 8 days had passed since the last run, OLIVER would
                    update. This accounted for holidays like Christmas. When the app booted up, it would check and
                    update if needed.</p>
                <p>I then used auto-py-to-exe to convert my script into a standalone app for any machine needing the
                    data.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="text-on-right">
                <p>Everything was looking peachy, and I was ready to deploy OLIVER across various machines. Then, the
                    inevitable happened. Brewman updated their program, changing the report structure and making my
                    reports obsolete.</p>
                <p>All wasn't lost. Since the main data for the app came from a CSV file, the brewers could still
                    manually update the data, and the app would display it nicely for everyone.</p>
                <p>I decided not to rebuild OLIVER for the new report structure and instead wait for the promised
                    Production API.</p>
                <p>For now, OLIVER is retired, and I eagerly await starting work on SON OF OLIVER‚ÄîSecond Optimised
                    Notation of Online Logs Information Verifier for Efficient Reporting. Stay tuned!</p>
