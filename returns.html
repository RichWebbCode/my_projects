                        I was approached by our brewers for a solution to tracking products that had been returned because of a quality
                        issue or complaint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our brewery management software can book returns for the driver to collect, but once the beer was back at the
                        brewery, the process ended and relied heavily on internal commincation accross departments. The right person 
                        had to remember to do the next task at the right time, which lead to a lot of missed tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I need a platform that everyoe could access to enter information and a resulting call to action for the next
                        person in chain. I decided a SharePoint list combined with a Power Automate flow would be the best solution.

                        I spoke to the Head Brewer and Head of Production, to find out what their requirments were. The main issue 
                        they faced was that they weren't aware of any returns until they arrived in the brewery yard. 
                        They wanted to be notified when a beer was returned. It seemed to me this was a step too late. I suggested 
                        adding a notification point when the initial point of contact, that was they could see if this was just a 
                        one off problem or if it was a larger issue that needed to be addressed before the product was returned to 
                        the brewery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They agreed that it would be useful to know as soon as a complaint was raised. My next stop was to speak to
                        the sales team and get their side of the issue. Since the sales team are the initial point of contact for any 
                        product quality issue, we agreed that they would be the best people to kick off the process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I went away and started to work on the impliementation.

                    <p>
                        Whatever system I put in place would need to be accessible to everyone. I wanted to send out emails that would 
                        notify the right person about the right action, at the right time. Product quality issues can be few and far 
                        between. I didn't want to have an app that would need to be checked. Each person would need a call to action, to
                        make this work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I decided on a SharePoint list with a custom form and Power Automate controlling each call to action.
