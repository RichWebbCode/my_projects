                        I was approached by our brewers for a solution to tracking products that had been returned because of a quality
                        issue or complaint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our brewery management software can book returns for the driver to collect, but once the beer was back at the
                        brewery, the process ended and relied heavily on internal commincation accross departments. The right person 
                        had to remember to do the next task at the right time, which lead to a lot of missed tasks.

                        I need a platform that everyoe could access to enter information and a resulting call to action for the next
                        person in chain. I decided a SharePoint list combined with a Power Automate flow would be the best solution.
                    </p>

                <div class=""text-on-right>
                    <p>
                        I spoke to the Head Brewer and Head of Production, to find out what their requirments were. The main issue 
                        they faced was that they weren't aware of any returns until they arrived in the brewery yard. 
                        They wanted to be notified when a beer was returned. It seemed to me this was a step too late. I suggested 
                        adding a notification point when the initial point of contact, that was they could see if this was just a 
                        one off problem or if it was a larger issue that needed to be addressed before the product was returned to 
                        the brewery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They agreed that it would be useful to know as soon as a complaint was raised.
